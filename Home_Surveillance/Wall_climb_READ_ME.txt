This code snippet is designed to detect if someone is trespassing the walls of a property (e.g., climbing or jumping onto the premises). There are two lines defined in the code:

LINE1_START and LINE1_END

LINE2_START and LINE2_END

These lines represent the top edges of the walls. Using the UI, assets can be added to the video feed, and these assets can be used to label the positions of the walls. The positions defined through the assets are then assigned to the respective lines in the code, enabling the system to monitor if a person crosses them.
